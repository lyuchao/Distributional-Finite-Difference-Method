Hi, this is the DFDM github organization site to host a family of distributional finite-difference method code repositories
![image](figures/basic_cube_sphere_mesh.png)
We (Chao Lyu, Yder Masson) are dedicated to open-source development for the computational seismology community.
If you want to follow and participate the development of DFDM, please follow us and contribute it.


If you use own code to implement your project, please cite at least one paper below
